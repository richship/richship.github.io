#Space Empires IV - Standard Empires

##Abbidon Enclave - Gas Giant, Carbon Dioxide
Abbidons are one of the few species to evolve on a gas giant. They have poor
eyesight, but compensate with a form of individual radar. They are peaceful artisans
and not easily provoked into war.

##Amon’krie Continuum - Ice, Methane
This is a highly intelligent species. They have advanced technology and awesome
warships. They are, however, physically weak.

##Cryslonite - Gas Giant, Hydrogen
A form of sentient crystal. Cryslonite’s regard other species as lesser life forms and
will attack and kill them. Cryslonites are considered psychotic. They don’t make
good negotiators.

##Cue Cappa Commonwealth - Rock, Oxygen
Composed of two symbiotic races –the Cue and Cappa. The Cappa are large squidlike
creatures, and the Cue are parasites that inhabit their bodies. An honorable
peace-loving race. They are slow to ally, but their friendship is a deep bond.

##Drushocka Empire - Rock, Methane
Although physically strong, the Drushoka are not exactly the sharpest pencils in the
galactic holder. They are straightforward in their dealings with other races, and
sworn enemies of the Eee.

##Eee Consortium - Gas Giant, Carbon Dioxide
A long-lived race, the Eee resemble Earth’s jellyfish. A peaceful race who are adept
at energy manipulation, the Eee had no military until they encountered the
Drushocka. The Drushocka’s energy-sapping weapons strike fear into the Eee.
Accordingly, the Eee responded with a massive military buildup.

##Fazrah - Rock, Oxygen
The Fazrah are orginally from a violent aquatic world. Their ocean was filled with
predators. Those difficult circumstances made the Fazrah a diverse and violent
culture. The Fazrah society is fragmented, and the different factions operate
independently. The Fazrah do not have a collective history as such. They travel in small
groups; their violent and reclusive nature does not lend itself well to relations with other species.
Their history is dominated by their use as mercenaries in various galactic wars.

##Jraenar Imperium - Rock, Hydrogen
Jreanar are an aggressive reptilian race. Strong and highly intelligent, the Jreanar
are committed to military expansion. They are a warrior culture in a military society.
No doubt, they make excellent allies or dreaded enemies.

##Krill Dominion - Rock, Carbon Dioxide
The Krill resemble a bird/reptile mix, and researchers believe they are an intelligent
dinosaur species that evolved within a carbon dioxide atmosphere. They stand three
meters tall and are bi-pedal with two tails. The Krill have the remnants of wings, but
they are unusable.
The Krill are driven by natural selection. Their society believes that the strongest are meant to
survive, and that all others must perish. Krills perform ritual elder culling in which they kill their
weakened elders. Their young are taught that they must fight to survive.
Female Krill lay 10-20 eggs a year, and a Krill’s average life span is approximately 40 years, but
because of elder culling, very few make it past 20 years. Their society is highly factionalized
with a dominant ruler coming to power only in the last 50 years. At present, they have resolved
their internal strife by refocusing on being superior to the aliens they encounter. In other words,
watch out!

##Norak Continuum - Rock Oxygen
The Norak are a semi-aquatic, amphibious species. They prefer a damp climate,
and enjoy dwelling on land. The Norak stand approximately two meters tall and are
tri-pedal. The average life span of a Norak is approximately 120 years. Unique to the
species is their uni-sex nature.
Historians believe that the Norak homeworld’s trinary star system is the cause of the Norak’s
deeply religious nature. In fact, the leader of their society is their high priest. Their society once
contained many different sects, but after a great "religious cleansing", only one remains.
Norak are erratic diplomats. Their religion allows them to help one species while destroying
another. If the Noraks find another race religiously lacking, they will attempt to wipe them out.

##Phong Confederation - Rock, Carbon Dioxide
The Phong are a hard-working people who love to mine. Hard work makes their
populations happy, and their society is peaceful. Their advanced Crystallurgy
technology makes them formidable opponents.

##Piundon Empire - Rock, Oxygen
The Piundon are an extremely violent silicon based species who have developed an
advanced crystalline based technology. They may transform their bodies at will from
solid to a semi-liquid state, but may not hold the change for prolonged periods. A
long-lived species, Piundon have an average lifespan of 300 years.
The Piundon are organized into occupation groups, with the politicians occupying their society’s
top rank. Many believe that the leaders of their society keep their own people in line by
continually waging war against nearby species.
The Piundon’s history is laced with war. Not only are they violent, but untrustworthy in dealings
with other species. War is the only constant in the lives of the Piundon.

##Praetorian Imperium - Rock, Oxygen
The Praetorians are a reclusive species. Their bodies are a semi-solid blob which
the Praetorians have enhanced with artificial exoskeletons. Without those
technological physical enhancements, the Praetorian move slowly and sense their
environment poorly.
The Praetorian live within an imperial government with an emperor considered to be the Son of
God. As such the people are pretty darned obedient. The Praetorians tend to be very reclusive
and solitary. Their horrific appearance is a serious impediment to race relations.

##Sallega Empire - Rock, Oxygen
A highly intelligent race, the Sallega are a dual-race humanoid species. They are
divided into the ruling Salrasha and the physically stronger worker Salzalum. Both
species are a pale beige color with a pasty skin and crystal blue eyes. Their average
lifespan is 15 years for the workers, and 120 years for the intellectuals.
The Sallega have had no internal problems of note, but their reaction to other races have been
mixed. The ruling elite, who are not used to being questioned, often have trouble relating to
other species. They have a tendency to treat everyone else as their servants. Over the
centuries, their race has become devoted to gaining a large stake of territory throughout the
galaxy. This goal has been greatly furthered by their recent discovery of temporal technology.

##Sergetti Empire - Ice, Oxygen
The Sergetti are an aquatic species approximately three meters long with a
serpentine body. This predominately male species has an average lifespan of 60
years. The Sergetti evolved on a planet that was barren of most other life forms, and
when the Sergetti blasted into space, they found that they had a distaste for
anything that was not like themselves. Accordingly, they rarely interact with other races.
The Sergetti carry their aquatic environment with them into space. Accordingly, the logistics of
transporting that much liquid inside their ships has led the Sergetti to be experts in space travel
and propulsion.

##Terran Confederation - Rock, Oxygen
The Terrans are an aggressive and intelligent species who wish to expand their
empire. They are strong warriors, but still have a culture based on trade.
Even a brief summary of Terran history would take volumes. The Terrans do have a
pronounced history of killing each other that stretches back to the beginning of their race. As a
result, they have become extremely proficient at the art.

##Toltayan Confederacy - Rock, Hydrogen
Humanoid in appearance with green eyes, the Toltayan have skin made of a tough
bark-like material. A tall race, their average height is approximately 2.5 meters and
their lifespan approximately 130 years.
A single king rules the entire Toltayan confederacy and he is determined by genetic lineage.
Natural engineers, the Toltayan society is distinctly divided into the ruling, worker, and military
class. Scholars believe that it is the naturally serene manner of the Toltayan which has allowed
peaceful coexistence between the different factions. In their entire history, their elected king has
never once been deposed or otherwise overthrown.

##Ukra-Tal Collective - Ice, Methane
The Ukra-Tal are a primordial people. A peaceful, agricultural race, the Ukra-Tal
excel in politics. Difficult to provoke, the Ukra-Tal are nevertheless strong warriors.

##Xiati - Rock, Oxygen
The Xiati are an aggressive race, known for their devious politics. They are known
to possess Temporal Manipulation technology. Xiati are a humanoid race, which
evolved on an Oxygen world. They stand approximately 2 meters tall, are dull
brown in appearance, and have striking dark black eyes. Their average lifespan is
approximately 70 years.
Originally the Xiati were not considered much of a threat to other species. They were intelligent
and aggressive, but their technology was a bit dated. That all changed when a Xiati scientist
discovered Temporal Manipulation. This new technology allowed the Xiati to manipulate time
itself. With an arsenal of devastating temporal weapons at their disposal, the Xiati became a
force to be reckoned with.

##XiChung Hive - Rock, Methane
A psychotic race of insects that are devoted to the destruction of all life other than
their own. The Xi'Chung’s behaviour is reminiscent of Earth's predatory mammals
such as wolves. They are social among themselves, yet unlike wolves, it appears
as though all Xi'Chung are equal, and all have an equal voice in the decisions of their empire. It
is strange that although there does not appear to a leader or ruling body and the Xi'Chung have
shown no telepathic ability, they still manage to function as if some sort of government existed.
